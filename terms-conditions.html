		<p>No guarantee is made that any follower will or is likely to achieve results comparable to those presented.
			There is often a large difference between theoretical performance
			and the actual results later reached by any trading platform. Furthermore, hypothetical Forex trading does
			not involve the risk of loss that exists in actual trading. There are
			many influencing factors related to either the market, in general, or to the specific implementation of any
			signal which can affect actual trading buy/sell results.</p>

			recommendations on the website should not be considered as a solicitation
			to buy or an offer to sell. The recommendations are not individual recommendations to a specific user.
			Trading Places is not an investment adviser, therefore, any trade ideas
