# Together Trading

I based my project on services related to making another stream of Income through the foreign exchange market (Forex).

In this website I'm trying to promote these services and showcase all the benefits that come with It. Did you know that 1 in 4 adults suffer from financial problems
and In recent studies the financial conduct authority say a further 50% of those "display one or more characteristics that signal their potential vulnerability".
The major worry with financial struggles Is the levels of stress and frustration It causes. Having seen this first hand I decided to set up Together Trading as
a way to help people make money and bring a community of together.

As-well-as full time work, I run my own online business with a team of partners giving tips and sharing the trades I will be taking for my clients to copy and 
profit as I do. Not only that, but for those who dont have the time to trade or dont want to go through the hassle of registering with a broker, I also provide
a management scheme where we do all the work and split the profits. Win, win for everyone.

## User Experience (UX)
In effect, this website Is for people looking for other ways to make money without physically having to do anything. This reaches a wide audience, anybody above 18
can be involved, and Is something that resonates with everyone. Afterall, who doesn't want to make more money?
As a client you can be as much or as little involved as you like. You can follow our analysis and data groups (which are free) and learn to trade yourself or we can
take out all the work and do It for you for a fee. A fee that will only be applied providing we meet all the profit requirements.  

Our account management scheme Is extremely retutable. We like to think of It as a glorified savings account.
For example, your average savings account with a bank Is around 3% per year. We offer 10% per month!
As a customer, knowing the numbers are great but does anyone acually take the time to work them out..
So lets do run some numbers:

Bank savings account:
- Initial investment: £1,000
- After the first month: £1,002.50 
- After the first year: £1,030.00

Our managed accounts:
- Initial investment: £1,000
- After the first month: £1,100 
- After the first year: £3,138.40

As you can see theres quite a difference.

## Features

Hero section: This Is the what you see straight away on the site. Enticing, big, bold text that lures the reader into finding out more. Also contains an image to further
describe the products and included two buttons, "find out more" and "contact" that can be used to Instantly direct the reader to that specific part on the page.

Services section: In this section we get a brief overview of what services we provide. Bullet points of the most Important advantages of each service, plus an Image to
help break up the section. I didn't want to add too much text so close to the top of the page because the reader might lose interest, so I just highlight the main points.
On Large display screens these display in-line, however, on medium and small screens they display on top of eachother with the text and Image staggered to look more
visually pleasing.

Why Invest section: By this point, hopefully the reader Is actually Interested In what we have to offer and Is reading to find out more. I break this Into three parts.. 
how, why and when. How we can make you money. Why you'd want to make an Investment. When Is the best time. Headings for each of these parts are made bigger and key points 
are highlighted and put Into bullet points to stand out.

Analysis section: This section talks about how we analyse charts and Identify potential trades. Split into two parts, funamental analysis and technical analysis. Each with
a relevant Icon, header and descriptive paragraph. On large display screens these appear In-line but for medium and small screens they go one on top of another to provide
better spacing and look more professional.

Callback section: This section allows the reader to fill out there details and request a callback from one of our dedicated team. Each text box has an relevant Icon and
placeholder text so the reader knows what Information goes Into what box. Also, the submit button cannot be pressed without filling In the boxes to prevent mistakes or
spam.

Social media section: This section includes an Image taken from one of our social groups to show what kind of content Is posted there. Also, for each social media page
theres a sentence explaining what you can expect to find from that particular platform. I have Included Interactive Icons for each of these and linked them to there
relevant page for quick and efficient access. Not only that but the links will open In a new tab so the reader doesnt lose the website.

Footer section: This section Includes the business email, address and legal documents which will take the reader to a new part of the website where they can read 
the fine prints. Theres also a copyright watermark with Includes my own added "signature" which I will hope to use on all the websites I create myself.

Hopefully when I become more experienced I would like to revisit this website and implement a collapsable navigation bar amongst other features.

## Deployment

Throughout this project Ive been making necessary 'commits' with messages to ensure my work Is backed up and to show the progression from start to finish.
I will be using GitHub to deploy the website. 

## Credits

All Images from the forex groups were taken by myself but the Icons were taken from google Images and edited to suit. These were then Imported Into GitPod
and can be found (assets/images/..).
